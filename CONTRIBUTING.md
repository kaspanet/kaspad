# Contributing to Kaspad

Any contribution to Kaspad is very welcome.

## Getting started

If you want to start contributing to Kaspad and don't know where to start, you can pick an issue from
the [list](https://github.com/kaspanet/kaspad/issues).

If you want to make a big change it's better to discuss it first by opening an issue or talk about it in
[Discord](https://discord.gg/WmGhhzk) to avoid duplicate work.

## Pull Request process

Any pull request should be opened against the development branch of the target version. The development branch format is
as follows: `vx.y.z-dev`, for example: `v0.8.5-dev`.

All pull requests should pass the checks written in `build_and_test.sh`, so it's recommended to run this script before
submitting your PR.
