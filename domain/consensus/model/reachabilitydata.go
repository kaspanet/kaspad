// MutableReachabilityData represents a node in the reachability tree
// of some DAG block. It mainly provides the ability to query *tree*
// reachability with O(1) query time. It does so by managing an
// index interval for each node and making sure all nodes in its
// subtree are indexed within the interval, so the query
// B ∈ subtree(A) simply becomes B.interval ⊂ A.interval.
//
// The main challenge of maintaining such intervals is that our tree
// is an ever-growing tree and as such pre-allocated intervals may
// not suffice as per future events. This is where the reindexing
// algorithm below comes into place.
// We use the reasonable assumption that the initial root interval
// (e.g., [0, 2^64-1]) should always suffice for any practical use-
// case, and so reindexing should always succeed unless more than
// 2^64 blocks are added to the DAG/tree.
//
// In addition, we keep a future covering set for every node.
// This set allows to query reachability over the entirety of the DAG.
// See documentation of FutureCoveringTreeNodeSet for additional details.

// ReachabilityData is a read-only version of a block's MutableReachabilityData
// Use CloneWritable to edit the MutableReachabilityData.
